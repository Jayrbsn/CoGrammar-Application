# CoGrammar-Application Full Stack Task
## Introduction
Before now, I have had no experience whatsoever in full-stack engineering, having only been exposed to the backend in my bootcamp, university courses and self study. 
As a result I was unable to meet all of the criterion listed in the take home test for this task. However, I am an excellent problem solver with a fine attention to detial and
I decided to learn as much about it as possible in the 9 days I was given to complete the task. The full-stack project included was done with the guidance of an online tutorial
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5ygXQKF6M8&t=627s). I chose a React JS + Python Django + SQLite stack because I have some experience with python and it seemed the most intuitive to me.

## The App
The app is an employee management database that keeps track of employees and departments within a company. It allows you to view, add, edit and delete departments and corresponding
employess within the company.

## How To Run It
As mentioned above this is my first attempt at a full-stack project so I'm not sure how to make it run on someone else's PC. I suggest you begin by saving the three subfolders found under 
this 'full stack' folder. Then follow these steps:

1. Open DjangoAngularTutorial folder
2. Then open DjangoAPI folder
3. Type cmd into the address bar of the folder to open the command prompt
4. Type in python manage.py runserver
5. Open ReactTut folder
6. Then open my-app folder
7. As before, type cmd into the address bar of the folder to open the command prompt
8. Then type in npm start
9. The above steps should launch the web app
