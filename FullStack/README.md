# CoGrammar-Application Full Stack Task
## Introduction
Before now, I have had no experience whatsoever in full-stack engineering, having only been exposed to the backend in my bootcamp, university courses and self study. 
As a result I was unable to meet all of the criterion listed in the take home test for this task. However, I am an excellent problem solver with a fine attention to detial and
I decided to learn as much about it as possible in the 9 days I was given to complete the task. The full-stack project included was done with the guidance of an online tutorial
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5ygXQKF6M8&t=627s). I chose a React JS + Python Django + SQLite stack because I have some experience with python and it seemed the most intuitive to me.

## The App
The app is an employee management database that keeps track of employees and departments within a company. It allows you to view, add, edit and delete departments and corresponding
employess within the company.
